#Angular Meteor Platform
Similar to the meteor-platform starter package but without loading
- blaze
- spacebars
- templating

but includes ```angular```

# WARNING:

If you meteor 1.2.0.2 it has a hidden jQuery dependency in static-html if you use attributes on the body tag i.e. ```<body ng-app="myApp">...</body>```. Therefore you need explicitly add the jQuery dependencies for now.
